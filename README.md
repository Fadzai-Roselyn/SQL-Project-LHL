# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To get more hands on and more familar with SQL
To try and figure out how to put across the queries but to also remember to ask for assistance where needed
To figure out how the data presented can help to answer questions about the ecommerce business

## Process
### (your step 1)
i. Creating the ecommerce database
ii. Clicking the dropdown arrow on the schema to access empty tables
iii. Right click on tables to start creating them, example;
     CREATE TABLE all_sessions (
  fullVisitorId NUMERIC,
  channelGrouping VARCHAR,
  time_ VARCHAR,
  country VARCHAR,
  city VARCHAR,
  totalTransactionRevenue NUMERIC,
  transactions NUMERIC,
  timeOnSite NUMERIC,
  pageviews INTEGER,
  sessionQualityDim NUMERIC,
  date DATE,
  visitId NUMERIC,
  type VARCHAR,
  productRefundAmount NUMERIC,
  productQuantity NUMERIC,
  productPrice NUMERIC,
  productRevenue NUMERIC,
  productSKU VARCHAR,
  v2ProductName VARCHAR,
  v2ProductCategory VARCHAR,
  productVariant VARCHAR,
  currencyCode VARCHAR,
  itemQuantity INTEGER,
  itemRevenue NUMERIC,
  transactionRevenue NUMERIC,
  transactionId VARCHAR,
  pageTitle VARCHAR,
  searchKeyword VARCHAR,
  pagePathLevel1 VARCHAR,
  eCommerceAction_type NUMERIC,
  eCommerceAction_step NUMERIC,
  eCommerceAction_option VARCHAR

)
iv. Loading the data into the created tables by right clicking on table and choosing the import option which leads to selecting the location of the data before clicking OK to confirm
### (your step 2)
Answering questions and coming up with my own questions for the data and figurung out if I have to clean data for a particular question
## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
I discovered the data could tell me about revenue. This is important as the business can make informed decisions including marketing campaigns and possibly customer loyalty programs based on the revenue. It also informs them about any growth or loss and it can be handled accordingly.

There is also some geographical data which shows how customers in different places behave or contribute to the business.
Given the product details, it is possible to analyse which products do well and which underperform. The geographical data if clean also shows patterns that will inform what products perform based in certain countries/cities, that forms a pattern and can inform the business on what to prioritize for certain regions.

The sentiment scores are an indicator of customer satisfaction or lack thereof, so it is an opprtunity for the business to retain customers by proactively addressing concerns, this goes hand in hand with the data that shows the top selling products, it means other data like restocking lead time can be used to ensure that the stock inventory is up to date with fast moving products and possibly on the look out to avoid stocking products that are not preferred by customers.

There is also a lot of data that shows customer behaviour in terms of how they interact with the ecommerce site. Most of the customers that end up there are from an organic se
